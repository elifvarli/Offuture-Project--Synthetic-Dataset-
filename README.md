# Offuture Descriptive Analytics Project (Synthetic Dataset)
 

This repository contains the code and documentation for the descriptive analytics project conducted for Offuture, an online global office and technology supply store. The project aimed to analyze Offuture's sales data from 2011 to 2015 to provide insights into the company's performance during that time period.

## Project Overview

The project was divided into two main phases:

 > Data Preparation and Quality Check:
The sales data provided by Offuture was loaded into hosted SQL tables.
Data quality checks were performed to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Data was cleaned and prepared for analysis.  
 > Visualization and Storytelling:
The cleaned data was visualized to explore trends and patterns in Offuture's sales performance.
Key points and insights were identified and presented in a logical manner to tell the story of Offuture's performance from 2011 to 2015.
